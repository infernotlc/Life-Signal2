  <h1>Overview</h1>
 <p>The Fall Detection App is designed to detect falls using a smartphone's built-in sensors. By leveraging an AI model, the app can distinguish between falls and other movements, providing accurate alerts and logging incidents for review.</p>

 <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Real-time Fall Detection</strong>: Monitors accelerometer and gyroscope data to detect falls.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-Powered Analysis</strong>: Uses a trained AI model to differentiate between falls and normal activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Alert System</strong>: Sends alerts to designated contacts in case of a fall.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Logging</strong>: Records sensor data and fall incidents for later analysis.</li>
        ! This project is under development later features are collecting datas from wear os watches !
